# NBA Home-Court Advantage Over Time

This repository analyzes how home-court advantage in the NBA has changed over time using historical, game-level data. We compare home and away performance across multiple eras to identify league-wide trends and team-level differences.

## Overview

This project explores how home-court advantage in the NBA has changed over time. We analyze historical, game-level NBA data to determine whether the advantage of playing at home has declined, increased, or remained consistent across different eras of the league. The analysis examines both league-wide trends and team-level differences by comparing home vs. away win percentages, point differentials, and other relevant metrics over multiple decades.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

## Current Plan

Our current plan is to:

1)Finalize and confirm the project topic and scope

2)Discover, verify, and evaluate potential NBA datasets

3)Clean and wrangle game-level data in R

4)Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends

5)Create clear and informative visualizations

6)Develop a coherent narrative around the findings

7)Assemble the final report using Quarto

8)Collaborate through GitHub for version control

9)Prepare a work-in-progress presentation

10)Complete final review and submit the project


## Repo Structure

1)data/ – Contains the raw and cleaned NBA game-level datasets used in the analysis. These data include game dates, home and away teams, game locations, final scores, and win/loss outcomes across multiple seasons and eras.

2)scripts/ – Where all analysis code lives. This folder stores R scripts used to clean and wrangle the data, perform exploratory data analysis, calculate home vs. away metrics, and generate visualizations.

3)figures/ – Stores all generated plots and visual outputs. This includes charts and graphs that illustrate trends in home-court advantage over time and differences across teams or eras.

4)report/ – Contains Quarto files used to assemble the final reproducible report. This is where the written analysis, tables, figures, and narrative explanations are combined.

5)README.md – Project overview and documentation. This file explains the purpose of the project, data sources, analysis goals, and how to navigate the repository.

6)Project Plan Document – The roadmap for the analysis. This document outlines the research questions, data sources, methodology, and planned workflow for the project.
